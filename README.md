# Privacy-By-Design

This project aims at developing and implementing methods of increasing the online customer’s awareness in e-commerce websites. In particular, after creating a questionnaire and handed it to the public, I have investigated that a large percent of the people does not read the Privacy policies or the terms and conditions, when visiting and registering at a website. Therefore, after analysing those results of the questionnaire and carrying out some research on the field, I was motivated to find a way in which I would encourage people to read carefully the privacy policies of the websites they are visiting.

My solution was the use of an image considering privacy policies of the personal information and additionally short, precise in bullet points privacy policies in a nicely styled boxes with checkbox functions. All these are present during the registration process.

The research method I used for achieving this aim was online questionnaires for data methods, and waterfall methodology for my system implementation.

#Aim

The aim of this project is to develop and implement methods of increasing the online customer’s awareness regarding the privacy policies and terms and conditions, and to encourage them to read those, particularly on e-commerce websites.

#Objectives

• To create a questionnaire and distribute it publicly, in order to determine the barriers that prevent the online users from fully reading the privacy policies and terms and conditions;

• To create an e-commerce website;

• To use a “popup modal box” in the index page, which will appear as soon as a user enters the website, with the purpose of informing them that the site values their privacy and encouraging them to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies;

• To create and embed an image which clearly demonstrates and depicts what information will be gathered and by whom, plus the exact way their personal information will be used. This image will appear before the user proceeds to the registration form;

• To present each individual policy in a separate white background box with red border. The use of white background and the red border colour is on purpose, in order to attract the customers’ attention to read the policies and terms and conditions. The division of the policies in the boxes is done in such a way as to make them easier to read and understand each policy separately, in a logical sequence;

• To create a checkbox in each separate section, which is required to be ticked once the user has read that policy part. In order for the customer to proceed to the next step, all the individual boxes have to be ticked;

• To implement these solutions into the e-commerce website created;

• To create another questionnaire in order to receive feedback and suggestions from online users, and implement what is considered productive;

• To report the outcome of the final evaluation
